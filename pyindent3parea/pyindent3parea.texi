  The pyindent3parea utility enables python programmers to use block structures along with the normal python indentation system.

When said that python file is block-structured then we mean that the python file is *correctly* block-structured by using 'comment dedent' #: or #:: ect.  as explained in this info.

The utility conforms to the following invariants.
@enumerate

@item
An line is never removed. Also an empty line is never removed.

@cindex empty lines

@item
A python file that is already indented and block-structured will not change by applying the operation again. (Idempotence)

@cindex idempotence

@item
When producing *indented* from *block-structured*, indentation of a correctly indented line is not changed, except when -f flag forces a given number of spaces to use for indentation.

@chapter Working principles

Decorating a python file with block-structure proceeds as follows:

Every INDENT is naturally prefixed with : at the end of the previous line.

A sole comment beginning with #: means DEDENT in the next line. #:: means two DEDENTS and so on. After that line a number of DEDENTS are implied.

Every DEDENT burst is prefixed with a sole comment on the previous line, i.e. #::: for 3 DEDENTS. If a comment already exists there and it has the form of one or more colons then it is changed to suit the number of DEDENTS: The number of DEDENTS is equal to the number of colons.

In fact, every indent is necessarily precedeed by : . At the dedent point we need to know how many dedents. The logical line could be ideally prefixed with a number of : (change python syntax slightly). Alternatively, #::: for 3 DEDENTS is placed at the end of the previous line.

If a comment stands on a line wich is otherwise not empty or contains anything more than # followed by a positive number of colons, eventually followed by some empty space (spaces and tabs), then such a comment is not considered significant and is never changed or otherwise used.

@node Example 1

@chapter Example 1

Assume the following correctly indented python program:

@verbatim
#! /usr/bin/python2.7

class foo1():

    def __init__(self, server, conn, addr):
        self.__bar1 = socket.getfqdn()
        try:
            self.__foo3 = bar3()
        except socket.error, err:

    def foo2(self):
        line = EMPTYSTRING.join(self.__line)
        print >> DEBUGSTREAM, 'Data:', repr(line)
        self.__line = []
        if self.__state == self.COMMAND:
            if not line:
                self.push('500 Error: bad syntax')
                return
            method = None

@end verbatim

By decorating we get:

@verbatim
#! /usr/bin/python2.7

class foo1(): 

    def __init__(self, server, conn, addr): 
        self.__bar1 = socket.getfqdn()
        try: 
            self.__foo3 = bar3() 
            #:
        except socket.error, err: #}

    def foo2(self): #{
        line = EMPTYSTRING.join(self.__line)
        print >> DEBUGSTREAM, 'Data:', repr(line)
        self.__line = []
        if self.__state == self.COMMAND: #{
            if not line: #{
                self.push('500 Error: bad syntax')
                return #}
            method = None #}}}

@node Known problems

@chapter Known problems

The parser consumes currently a lot of stack. That results in a 'segmentation fault' for large python files. The problem will be fixed. The remedy for the time beeing is to enlarge the stack with 'ulimit'.
